# Eye-Exercise
MITxPro BootCamp - Full Stack Development MERN - Week 8 CSS styling 

## Description: 
Eye exercise using CSS style to display tracking of mouse cursor in DOM.

## Installation: 
Create repository with files

## Usage: 
Displays in web browser, for Demo purposes. If you would like to manipulate then you should adjust the JS file. JS does the eye movement functionality, css styles it and index is used to run.

## Support: 
If you have question email: tomlepham@gmail.com

## Roadmap: 
Would love to add more features to the movement and maybe add tap or toggle features.
